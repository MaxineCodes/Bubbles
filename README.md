# Bubbles Raytracing Renderer
 
The Bubbles raytracing rendering engine is a GUI offline raytracing engine project which only renders `Bubbles` (spheres) using C++. <br/>
Qt is used for the GUI. 2D graphics & icons were made with Adobe Illustrator.

The Bubbles app will be a relatively simple 3D DCC program, where you can place spheres around the scene, assign materials, and render a final image. <br/>
My focus on this project is to get it to work at all, optimization is less important to me in this project as I am still learning the basics of graphics programming. <br/>
I hope this project turns out well!!
